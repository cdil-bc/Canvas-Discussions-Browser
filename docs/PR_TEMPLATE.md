# Pull Request: Student Claiming & Real-time Status System

## Overview

This PR introduces a real-time student claiming system using Convex as the backend. It allows facilitators to "claim" students they're actively providing feedback to, preventing duplicate effort and providing visibility into who is responding to which student.

## 📋 Summary

- **Feature**: Student-level claiming system for discussion feedback
- **Backend**: Convex real-time database integration
- **UI**: Claiming interface on student profile pages and status indicators on dashboard
- **Real-time**: Live status updates across all facilitators

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### New Dependencies

- `convex`: Real-time backend-as-a-service for status management

### Core Files Added/Modified

- `convex/` - Complete Convex setup and configuration
  - `convex/schema.ts` - Student status data model
  - `convex/canvas.ts` - Status management functions
- `pages/user/[user_name].js` - Added `StudentClaimStatus` component
- `pages/feedback.js` - Added real-time status integration
- `components/ui/StudentBadge.js` - Updated to show claim status

### Key Features

1. **Student-Level Claiming**: Facilitators can claim entire students (not individual threads)
2. **Real-time Updates**: Status changes appear immediately for all facilitators
3. **Three States**: Unclaimed → Claimed → Completed
4. **Facilitator Tracking**: Shows who claimed/completed each student
5. **Self-Management**: Only the claiming facilitator can change their own claims

## 🎯 Implementation Decisions

### Why Student-Level vs Thread-Level?

Initially planned thread-level claiming, but realized facilitator workflow is student-centric. A facilitator reviews a student's entire body of work, not individual posts.

### Why Convex?

- Real-time collaboration out of the box
- No server setup required
- Optimistic updates for responsive UI
- Automatic synchronization across clients

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Setup (First Time)

1. Sign up for Convex account at https://convex.dev
2. Install Convex CLI: `npm install -g convex`
3. Run `npx convex dev` to initialize project
4. Deploy schema: `npx convex deploy`

### For Facilitators

1. **Set Your Name**: Go to Settings → Set "Facilitator Name" (required for claiming)
2. **Claim Student**: On student profile page, click "Claim Student"
3. **Mark Complete**: After providing feedback, click "Mark as Complete"
4. **Dashboard View**: Student badges show claim status with color coding
   - Red: Needs grading
   - Yellow: Claimed by someone
   - Green: Completed

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Can claim a student from their profile page
- [ ] Claim status appears on dashboard immediately
- [ ] Other facilitators see the claim in real-time
- [ ] Only claiming facilitator can change status
- [ ] Can mark student as complete
- [ ] Can unclaim/reset status
- [ ] Works without facilitator name (shows appropriate error)

### Test Scenarios

1. **Multi-facilitator**: Have 2+ people test claiming different students
2. **Status Changes**: Test all state transitions (unclaimed → claimed → completed)
3. **Error Handling**: Test without setting facilitator name
4. **Real-time**: Verify changes appear immediately on other screens

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

### Environment Setup

The feature requires Convex environment variables. After merging:

1. Set up production Convex deployment
2. Configure environment variables in hosting platform
3. Update Convex dashboard URL in admin panel

### Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the feature can be disabled by:

1. Commenting out Convex provider in `_app.js`
2. Student claiming UI will gracefully degrade (won't show claiming buttons)

## 📚 Documentation

- **Complete Implementation Guide**: `projects/prd-discussion-claiming.md`
- **Git Worktree Workflow**: `docs/GIT_WORKTREE_HOWTO.md`
- **Architecture Decisions**: See PRD for full evolution from thread-level to student-level

## 🤝 Collaboration Notes

This is our first major collaborative feature! Some things we learned:

- Git worktrees are excellent for comparing implementations
- Student-centric design is more intuitive than thread-centric
- Real-time features need careful state management
- PRD documentation was crucial for tracking decision evolution

## 🔍 Review Focus Areas

1. **Convex Integration**: Schema design and query patterns
2. **Real-time UX**: Status update responsiveness and error handling
3. **Component Architecture**: Clean separation between UI and state management
4. **Error Boundaries**: Graceful degradation when Convex is unavailable

**Ready for Review!** This represents a complete student claiming system with real-time collaboration features. The implementation is documented thoroughly and includes migration path from our previous thread-based approach.
