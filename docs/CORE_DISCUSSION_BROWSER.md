#### **Canvas API Setup**

## Technical Architecture

### **API Proxy Pattern** (`/api/canvas-proxy.js`)

#### **CORS Solution**
- **Server-Side Proxy**: All Canvas API requests routed through Next.js API route
- **Security**: API tokens never exposed to client-side code
- **Request Forwarding**: Accepts `apiUrl`, `apiKey`, `endpoint`, `method`, `body` parameters
- **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status code forwarding and error messages

### **Canvas API Integration** (`js/canvasApi.js`)

#### **Core Functions**

##### `fetchCanvasDiscussions()`
- **Complete Data Fetching**: Gets all discussion posts across all topics
- **Pagination Handling**: Loops through all pages with `per_page=100`
- **Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate posts using Set-based ID tracking
- **Data Enrichment**: Adds topic titles and assignment IDs to posts
- **Reply Fetching**: Recursively fetches all replies for each post

##### `fetchCanvasUserPosts()` 
- **User Filtering**: Extracts posts by specific user (display name or user ID)
- **Reply Inclusion**: Gets all replies to user's posts (regardless of reply author)
- **Thread Organization**: Maintains parent-child relationships between posts

##### Cache Management
- **Browser Storage**: Uses localStorage for client-side caching
- **Cache Key**: `canvas_discussions_${courseId}` for course-specific storage
- **Manual Refresh**: No automatic expiry - persists until user refreshes
- **Performance**: Near-instant navigation after initial load

### **Security Features**

#### **Content Sanitization**
- **DOMPurify Integration**: All HTML content sanitized before rendering
- **XSS Prevention**: Removes malicious scripts and unsafe content
- **Safe HTML Rendering**: Uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` only after sanitization

#### **Data Protection**
- **Local Storage Only**: Credentials stored in browser localStorage
- **No Third-Party Transmission**: All data stays between browser and Canvas
- **API Token Security**: Tokens handled server-side via proxy

### **Browser Caching System**

#### **Performance Optimization**
- **Persistent Storage**: Cache survives browser sessions
- **Manual Control**: User controls when to refresh data
- **Cache Indicators**: Visual feedback showing cache status and timestamps
- **Grading Session Support**: Cache persists during long grading sessions

#### **Cache States**
- **"‚ö° Last refreshed: [timestamp]"** (green): Shows cached data age
- **"üîÑ Fresh data"** (blue): Indicates newly fetched data
- **Manual refresh button**: Forces cache clear and data reload
