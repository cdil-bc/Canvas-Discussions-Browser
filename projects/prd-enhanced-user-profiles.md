# Product Requirements Document: Enhanced User Profiles with Database Integration

## Executive Summary
Transform the Canvas Discussion Browser into a comprehensive user management platform by adding persistent user profiles, database integration with Convex, authentication, CSV import capabilities, manual editing interface, and AI-powered content analysis.

## Problem Statement

### Current Limitations
- **No User Context**: Only Canvas discussion data available, no institutional or role information
- **No Persistence**: User data exists only during browser session
- **Limited Analytics**: Cannot analyze by institution, role, or user-defined categories
- **Single User**: No sharing or collaboration capabilities between instructors
- **Manual Work**: No way to bulk import or manage user information efficiently

### Business Impact
- Instructors lack comprehensive view of student context
- No institutional analytics or cross-course insights
- Inefficient user data management for large courses
- Limited collaboration between teaching staff

## Solution Overview
Create a comprehensive user profile system with database persistence, authentication, bulk import capabilities, manual editing interface, and AI-powered insights extraction from discussion content.

## Success Metrics

### Functionality Metrics
- **100% data integrity**: No loss of existing Canvas functionality
- **Real-time updates**: Changes visible immediately across users
- **Import accuracy**: >95% successful user matching from CSV
- **AI accuracy**: >80% confidence for assistant type detection

### Performance Metrics
- **Page load time**: <2 seconds for user profile pages
- **Edit responsiveness**: <500ms for save operations
- **Import speed**: <30 seconds for 100-user CSV files
- **Sync reliability**: 99.9% uptime for Canvas-Convex sync

### User Experience Metrics
- **Learning curve**: <30 minutes for existing users to adopt new features
- **Error rate**: <5% user errors during editing operations
- **Feature adoption**: >80% usage of enhanced profile features within 30 days

## Technical Considerations

### Data Synchronization Strategy
- **Canvas → Convex**: One-way sync for identification and posts
- **Manual → Convex**: Real-time updates with optimistic locking
- **CSV → Convex**: Bulk operations with transaction safety
- **AI → Convex**: Background processing with approval queue

### User Matching Logic
1. **Primary Match**: Canvas `display_name` exactly matches CSV name
2. **Email Match**: Canvas email matches CSV email (if available)
3. **Fuzzy Match**: Use existing `normalizeNameForMatching` from `dataUtils.js`
4. **Manual Resolution**: Present conflicts for user review
5. **Confidence Scoring**: Rate match quality for user validation

### Data Precedence Rules
1. **Manual edits** always take highest precedence
2. **CSV imports** update fields not manually edited
3. **AI analysis** only populates empty fields or with explicit approval
4. **Canvas data** remains read-only but syncs automatically

### Security & Privacy
- **Encrypted Storage**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for data access
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all data modifications
- **API Security**: Canvas tokens encrypted and rotated regularly

### Performance Optimization
- **Caching Strategy**: Client-side caching for frequently accessed data
- **Lazy Loading**: Load enhanced data only when needed
- **Background Sync**: Non-blocking Canvas data updates
- **Query Optimization**: Efficient database queries with proper indexing

## Cost Analysis

### Infrastructure Costs
- **Convex Database**: $25-50/month (100-1000 users)
- **AI Processing**: $10-30/month (content analysis)
- **Authentication**: Included in Convex pricing
- **Total Monthly**: $35-80 for full-featured system

### Development Investment
- **Initial Development**: 12-14 weeks (can be phased)
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: ~4-8 hours/month
- **ROI Timeline**: 2-3 months based on time savings

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Data Migration**: Risk of data loss during Canvas → Convex migration
  - *Mitigation*: Extensive backup and testing procedures
- **Performance**: Potential slowdown with large user datasets
  - *Mitigation*: Proper indexing and caching strategies
- **AI Accuracy**: Variable quality of AI-extracted insights
  - *Mitigation*: Manual review workflow and confidence scoring

### Business Risks
- **User Adoption**: Resistance to new manual data entry requirements
  - *Mitigation*: Gradual rollout with training and CSV import options
- **Cost Overrun**: AI processing costs higher than expected
  - *Mitigation*: Usage monitoring and cost controls
