# Product Requirements Document: Component-Based Architecture Refactoring

## Executive Summary
Refactor the Canvas Discussion Browser from duplicated page-level code to a clean, component-based React architecture to improve maintainability, consistency, and development velocity.

## Problem Statement

### Current Issues
- **Code Duplication**: 200+ lines of identical header/navigation code across 4+ pages
- **Canvas API Setup**: 100+ lines of credential management duplicated across pages
- **Loading/Error States**: 50+ lines of status handling repeated everywhere
- **Cache Management**: 75+ lines of cache logic duplicated across components
- **Styling Inconsistencies**: Minor differences in layout and component styling
- **Maintenance Burden**: Changes require updates to multiple files
- **Development Friction**: New features require recreating existing patterns

### Business Impact
- Slower development cycles due to code duplication
- Higher bug risk from inconsistent implementations
- Increased maintenance costs
- Poor developer experience

## Solution Overview
Create a comprehensive component library that eliminates duplication and establishes a consistent design system across all pages in the Canvas Discussion Browser application.

## Technical Requirements

    â””â”€â”€ GradingIndicator.js    # Grading status badges
```

### Core Components Specifications

#### 1. CanvasProvider (Context)
- Manage Canvas API credentials (apiUrl, apiKey, courseId)
- Handle course name fetching and caching
- Provide credential validation
- Expose loading and error states

#### 2. Layout Component
- Consistent page wrapper (`min-h-screen bg-gray-50`)
- Include Header and Navigation components
- Accept children for page content
- Handle responsive layout

#### 3. Custom Hooks
- **useCanvasAuth**: Credential management and localStorage integration
- **useCanvasCourse**: Course data fetching and error handling
- **useCanvasCache**: Cache management and refresh logic

#### 4. UI Components
- **LoadingSpinner**: Consistent loading states with Canvas branding
- **ErrorMessage**: Standardized error display with styling
- **StatusBadge**: Cache indicators ("âš¡ Last refreshed", "ðŸ”„ Fresh data")
- **RefreshButton**: Standardized refresh functionality

### Migration Strategy

#### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)
1. Create `components/` directory structure
2. Implement `CanvasProvider` context
3. Build `Layout`, `Header`, `Navigation` components
4. Create custom hooks for Canvas integration
5. Update `_app.js` to use CanvasProvider

#### Phase 2: UI Components (Week 1-2)
1. Extract loading/error states into reusable components
2. Create standardized button and badge components
3. Build cache management components
4. Implement credentials required component

#### Phase 3: Discussion Components (Week 2)
1. Extract topic card component from grading dashboard
2. Create user card component from users page
3. Build reusable post display components
4. Create grading status indicators

#### Phase 4: Page Refactoring (Week 2-3)
1. Refactor `index.js` (grading dashboard) to use components
2. Refactor `users.js` to use components
3. Refactor `settings.js` and individual user pages
4. Update analysis, verify, and other pages

#### Phase 5: Cleanup & Documentation (Week 3)
1. Remove duplicate code from pages
2. Update component documentation
3. Add component examples and usage guidelines
4. Update project documentation

## Success Metrics

### Code Quality
- **90% reduction** in duplicate code across pages
- **100% functional parity** maintained during migration
- **Zero regression** in existing functionality
- **Consistent UI/UX** across all pages

### Developer Experience
- **Faster development** for new features (reuse existing components)
- **Easier maintenance** (change once, applies everywhere)
- **Better testing** (test components in isolation)
- **Improved code review** (smaller, focused changes)

### Performance
- **No performance degradation** from component abstraction
- **Maintain existing caching behavior**
- **Preserve bundle size** or achieve slight improvements

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper prop validation with PropTypes or TypeScript
- Follow existing naming conventions and file structure
- Maintain Boston College color scheme and branding

### Testing Strategy
- Test each component in isolation
- Verify page functionality after each migration
- Maintain existing integration test coverage
- Add component-specific unit tests

### Rollback Plan
- Keep original page files as backups during migration
- Implement feature flags if needed for gradual rollout
- Maintain git history for easy rollback
- Test thoroughly before removing duplicate code

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- React hooks and context API (already in use)
- Next.js Pages Router architecture (existing)
