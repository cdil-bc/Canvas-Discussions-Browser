## Reflection 1
After the module 1 live session, your assignment is to submit a response to at least 2 of the following prompts:

- What are your takeaways from your conversation with the Idea Discovery Assistant? 

- What kind of AI assistant/chatbot are you thinking about prototyping?

## Reflection 2
Prototyping is a cornerstone of design thinking and creative problem solving, enabling you to test your ideas and build momentum. It’s also an effective way to drive changes in process, behavior, and culture. As author Jerry Sternin wrote: “It's easier to act your way into a new way of thinking, than think your way into a new way of acting.”

**After the module w live session**, your assignment is to **submit a response to at least 2 of the following prompts**:

- What has surprised you most about the process of creating a chatbot so far?
- In your opinion, which design elements (eg, role, skills, process/sequence, norms, conversational style) are the most crucial? Which are least crucial? Why?
- Predict how others will experience your chatbot. Describe the best-case scenario as well as the worst-case scenario. Don’t be afraid to write out a mock transcript to play out the interactions.

## Reflection 3
**After the Module 3 live session**, your assignment is to **share the experience of using your AI assistant or chatbot. Submit a 2-3 minute video or a written response that addresses the following prompts:**

- Summarize where you ended up with your prototype AI assistant or chatbot. _A submission of a direct link to your AI assistant or chatbot is not required, but we encourage sharing a link in the spirit of learning and collaboration._
- Reflect on your experience as a learner:
    - How has it felt to try to build and test a custom AI assistant? Does it come naturally to you or has it taken some adjustment?
    - How does this compare to other ways you've learned about AI?
- Then, summarize where you hope to go next:
    - With your chatbot: Do you plan to keep developing it? If so, in what ways?
    - With your own learning: based on your experience in this lab, how do you plan to approach your ongoing learning about AI?
