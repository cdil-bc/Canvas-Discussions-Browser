I'm also interested in the use of submitting images to AI to create datasets or provide answers that can't be reported on because the absence of data can't be reported out of platforms. In the instances I'm considering, a manual count can acquire the information, albeit time-consuming, which acts as a barrier to making important actionable data-driven decisions. An example of ""absence of data"" in my work is the unscheduled appointment block availability of career coaches at the career center. Determining these unscheduled appointment blocks would allow me to calculate appointment block fill rates for each coach, thus permitting a more targeted strategy for each career cluster in offering and marketing coaching services.","I've attempted this with Gemini but the image resolution is too low for accurate counting within a week's Google Calendar view. I adjusted my Calendar settings to achieve the highest contrast and removed fade out of past meetings / days. I used the department scanner to attempt to increase the resolution but that didn't work either. Additionally, it struggles with overlapping meetings (e.g. sometimes we have meetings that are are on our calendars just as an FYI or it's project work). It seems that it can't accurately reference any meeting in the second position on the same date and time.
